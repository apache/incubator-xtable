# This file contains the default configuration of known OneTable tableFormatsClients for both source and target
# table formats. The config maps a table format name to a client class, and contains the default configuration
# values needed by the client.

# sourceClientProviderClass: The class name of a table format's client factory, where the client is
#     used for reading from a table of this format. All user configurations, including hadoop config
#     and client specific configuration, will be available to the factory for instantiation of the
#     client.
# targetClientProviderClass: The class name of a table format's client factory, where the client is
#     used for writing to a table of this format.
# configuration: A map of configuration values specific to this client.
