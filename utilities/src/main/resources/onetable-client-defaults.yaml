## This file contains the default configuration of known OneTable tableFormatsClients for both source and target
## table formats. The config maps a table format name to a client class, and contains the default configuration
## values needed by the client.

## sourceClientProviderClass: The class name of a table format's client factory, where the client is
##     used for reading from a table of this format. All user configurations, including hadoop config
##     and client specific configuration, will be available to the factory for instantiation of the
##     client.
## targetClientProviderClass: The class name of a table format's client factory, where the client is
##     used for writing to a table of this format.
## configuration: A map of configuration values specific to this client.
