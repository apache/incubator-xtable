# values needed by the client.

#     used for reading from a table of this format. All user configurations, including hadoop config
#     and client specific configuration, will be available to the factory for instantiation of the
#     client.
# targetClientProviderClass: The class name of a table format's client factory, where the client is
#     used for writing to a table of this format.
