## [Release 0.3.0-incubating](https://github.com/apache/incubator-xtable/releases/tag/0.3.0-incubating) ([docs](https://xtable.apache.org/docs/how-to))
This is the third official Apache release for Apache XTable (Incubating), an incubating project under the Apache Software Foundation.
Apache XTableâ„¢ (Incubating) facilitates omni-directional interoperability across data processing systems and query engines by allowing users to convert between open table formats without the need to rewrite any data files.
Currently, Apache XTableâ„¢ (Incubating) supports the open-source table formats for Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, and Delta Lake.

## âœ¨ What's Changed
