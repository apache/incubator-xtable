# Community

We have set up the following regular syncs for community users and developers to meet, interact and exchange ideas. Meetings will be recorded and made available after every sync.


## Bi-weekly Community Call
Participate in our Community Calls by joining us on [Google Meet](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MjBuOWl0c21sdWIzcDQydGRubzJrb3QybHZfMjAyNTAxMjdUMTYwMDAwWiBjXzEwNDgzYzU2Yjc0ZGRjZWI5N2RjMGZhNTk2MjQ5YmU5MWVlY2RmOWQ4MjZkNzI3MmEwZjcxNTMzMWI1NzIzMTlAZw&tmsrc=c_10483c56b74ddceb97dc0fa596249be91eecdf9d826d7272a0f715331b572319%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL) by adding the invite to your calendar.

## Join the Community on Slack
We have a [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/apachextablei-yoi8504/shared_invite/zt-2y9hqskhv-ZfSwoxzq~PTJlWGj0V1sQw) that you can join for help with any questions, issues, design choices, announcements, etc.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Getting Started

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
- Open a pull request (PR) against the main branch with a clear summary of your changes.
  - Use descriptive commit messages. 
  - Write or update unit tests where applicable.
- Refer to the [README](https://github.com/apache/incubator-xtable/blob/main/README.md) for more detailed setup instructions.

### Pull Request Review Process

- All PRs are reviewed by project committers.
- Review comments may request changes, please try to update the PR within a reasonable time.
- We aim to keep the review loop tight and collaborative.

### Handling Stale Pull Requests

- To keep development moving and reduce backlog, PRs with no activity for many days may be marked as stale. 
- A committer may pick up a stale PR, incorporate necessary changes (including rebasing or completing the implementation), and merge it. 
- Attribution to the original author will always be preserved in the commit history. This helps prevent good contributions from getting lost due to inactivity, while staying aligned with Apacheâ€™s community-first philosophy.
