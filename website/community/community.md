# Community

We have setup the following regular syncs for community users and developers to meet, interact and exchange ideas. Meetings will be recorded and made available after every sync.
We have a slack channel [link] you can join for asking any clarification questions.

## Bi-weekly Community Call
Participate in our community calls by joining us on Gmeet link https://meet.google.com/zmz-bcwa-yct (or zoom link ?)
Should we create a recurring invite in Google calendar and provide the meeting url, users can add it to their calendar ?


## Recordings of the community calls
Add Google driver link for recordings.


## Typical agenda
Agenda doc used for the first meeting. Is this doc okay or should we use a better process
