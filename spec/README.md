# Open API spec

The `rest-service-open-api.yaml` defines the api contract for running table format conversion using XTable's REST service.
This spec is still under active development and is subject to changes.

## Lint

To make sure that the open-api definition is valid, you can run the `lint` command:

This will first run `make install`, which in turn will create the venv (if needed) and install openapi-spec-validator
```sh
make lint
```

if you want to wipe out the venv and start fresh run make clean
```sh
make clean
```

## Generate 

Note: Youâ€™ll need the OpenAPI Generator CLI installed and on your `PATH`. You can install it using Homebrew:
```sh
brew install openapi-generator
```
Then to generate the java models from the open-api spec, you can run the `generate-models` command.

```sh
make generate-models
```
If you would to remove the generated models, you can run the `clean-models` command:
```sh
make clean-models
```
